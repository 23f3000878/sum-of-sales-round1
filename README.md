## Project Description
The `sum-of-sales` project is a single-page application that reads sales data from a CSV file, calculates the total sales, and presents the results in a user-friendly format. Designed with Bootstrap 5, it provides a clean and responsive layout while ensuring an efficient data processing experience. The title of the page is set to "Sales Summary 2025", and the computed total sales value is displayed prominently on the page.

## Features
- Fetches sales data from `data.csv` file.
- Sums the 'sales' column from the CSV data.
- Dynamically updates the page title to "Sales Summary 2025".
- Displays the total sales in a designated area.
- Utilizes Bootstrap 5 for responsive design.
